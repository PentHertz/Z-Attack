## Installation

### Prerequisites

This tool is compatible with:
- **RfCat** (requires rflib)
- **Texas Instruments development KIT** (with UART bridge)

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/penthertz/z-attack.git
cd z-attack
```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Install Graphviz (for static network graph export):**

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
apt-get install graphviz
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install graphviz
```

**Windows:**
Download from [https://graphviz.org/download/](https://graphviz.org/download/)

4. **Install RfCat (if using RfCat device):**
```bash
# Follow installation instructions at:
# https://github.com/atlas0fd00m/rfcat
```

## Quick Start - S2 Decryption

**Want to decrypt S2 encrypted Z-Wave Plus traffic? Here's how:**

1. **Get the DSK** (Device Specific Key) from your device label/QR code

2. **Start Z-Attack:**
   ```bash
   python3 zattack-ImGUI.py
   ```

3. **Add DSK:** Menu ‚Üí Add S2 DSK ‚Üí Enter Node ID and DSK

4. **Pair the device** (Z-Attack captures key exchange automatically)

5. **Done!** All S2 messages now decrypt automatically
